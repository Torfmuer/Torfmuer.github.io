    <h1> Wine Bars Take Over</h1>
    <h2> By: Robert W. </h2>

So the first thing that you think of when I say "Wine Tasting" is probably the decrepit and crusty old wine cellars that old people on their death bed go to flex their lifetime earnings. <br><br>
 
This is not the case in modern England! Due to the shifting of cultural norms since COVID-19 paired with rising beer prices, more people are gathering newly cropping up wine bars. <br><br>
 
So, instead of the rowdy and uncouth sports pubs we’re all accustomed to, imagine a wine bar… “We look for accessible-tasting bottles and talk about delicious wine.” Says Redford, the owner of a newly opened wine bar in Londan name Forza. <br><br>

This push for accessible-tasting wine speaks to the wine industries desire to cater to a new and younger audience, with wine being served cool cars and accompanied by fresh snacks. <br><br>
 
This notion is seconded by a secondary push for what is called ‘natural wine’. These are wines that are not made with preservatives or additives in the wine making process. <br><br>
 
Although this trend my not be directly tied to this appeal to the younger generations, it certainly represents the wine industries willingness to change an adapt to the times. <br><br>
 
Additionally, one of the most important part of a wine bar experience is your interaction with the seller or person manning the bar. In recent years wine sellers and wine bar owners have put an increase of investment into training their employees to better interact with their customers. <br><br>
 
All of these changes represent the constantly shifting and changing culture of wine in England.<br><br>

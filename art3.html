    <h1>Best Attractions to Avoid in Cardiff</h1>
    <h2>By: Garrett Daviscourt</h2>
    
    Sometimes it is easier to eliminate the things you don't want to do, as opposed to finding the things you do. Hence my selection of this 
    article that was published on Mirror, a British publication.<br><br> I appreciate the title, "Three people thrown from Winter Wonderland ride in Cardiff after
    'massive bang'", as it is very cut and dry. No clickbait. <br><br>At 5pm on November 28th, 2022, three people were thrown from a ride in Gorsend Gardens in Cardiff; not off to a great start. It seems as if many bystanders were 
    alarmed by a large bang. <br><br>In my opinion, this seems like a good place to avoid. <br><br>

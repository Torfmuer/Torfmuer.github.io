        This article piqued my interest because it was so simple. Rather than a big headline of BREAKING NEWS, 
        this is a close-to-home issue facing many people, but not one the majority of people would likely be 
        interested in reading, unless it faces them of course. Due to the water outage in London, areas across 
        the city are having to close school, conserve what little water they have, or seek other places to do their 
        watery business. Londoners cannot take showers, do their dishes or laundry, or drink water from their 
        fridge. London water company Thames Water put out a list of areas being affected, promising to fix the 
        issue as quickly as possible. The culprit – a burst pipe, one which Thames was able to fix. Apparently 
        there was a burst sewer as well. While the problems have been fixed now, it will take some time for all 
        residents to receive their full water pressure again, but the company assures them that it will steadily 
        increase over the next few days. The article is helpful, concise, and clear in its messaging. In order to 
        disseminate accurate information quickly and efficiently, concision and clarity are of the utmost 
        importance. While in London, we may need to find places to take a shower! Therefore it may be best to 
        avoid the areas which are out of water. All joking aside, I see ‘simpler’ stories such as a simple water 
        outage to be a good peak into the mundane of daily life in another country. While big news stories can 
        be important, simple stories can show much more about the people and daily life of a country we are to 
        visit.

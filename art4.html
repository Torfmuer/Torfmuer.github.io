    <h1> BindHQ</h1>
    <h2> By: Robert W. </h2>

    Who is BindHQ? BindHQ is a seamless quoting, policy issuing, business-binding Insurtech empowering tomorrow's leading MGU's, MGA's and wholesale insurance brokers to produce more in a fraction of the time.
    Or at least this is what it says directly on their website. To break that down, first there is the word 'Insurtech'. 
    This word is an amalgamation of the word's insurance technology (seriously? You don't need to abbreviate that, it's already pretty short). 
    MGA stands for managing general agent and MGU stands for managing general underwriter. BindHQ's mission is to streamline the distribution of insurance through smarter software. 
    Combining software and insurance as an interdisciplinary. 
    BindHQ market themselves as a new and fresh actor in a small but growing sector of the insurance market and a disruptor in a landscape of complacent and incumbent actors. 
    The core deliverable that BindHQ offers is a “redefined” AMS for specialty insurance agencies. 
    AMS stands for agent management system. 
    BindHQ uses cloud technologies to deliver the functionality of multiple levels of bureaucracy in a frictionless program. 
    Their software offers six different functionalities. 
    Policy administration, to track submissions, quotes, endorsements, documents and invoices. 
    Insurance accounting, designed to streamline a cumbersome process. 
    Reporting compliance ensured by the standard formatting they use. 
    Program administration, which is entirely fluff, but looks great. 
    Integration and API, meaning that they pride themselves on their user friendly application programming interface, and has decent security features with no fluff in their application. 
    Operational reporting, helping to streamline the business pipeline from you to your boss by providing convenient communication methods of every nuance. 
    This application is a prime example of the interdisciplinary of computer science and insurance and finance. 
    They found a nuanced market with a niche need for this massive quality of life upgrade and are marketing towards that end.

As temperatures rise across the UK, thousands of homes in London have either been left without 
running water or are experiencing low pressure.<br><br>
Since this incident, the water provider has apologised to customers after many were left 
wondering why their water was not working properly.<br><br>
“No water in my house in TW6,” one user wrote on X/Twitter, and another user said, “No water 
since this morning!”<br><br>
As the pressure continues to rise, the agency wrote on social media and said it was “sorry for the 
disruption”.<br><br>
It added: “Following a power issue in West London some customers have no water or low 
pressure this morning.<br><br>
“We’re sorry for the disruption and we are working hard to fix the issue. For more details 
including a list of affected postcodes see.”<br><br>
Here is a list of places that were impacted by the issue of no water or low-pressure
Thames Water put out a list of areas impacted by the low water or no water pressure – these are:<br><br>
South London, including Lambeth, Brixton and more: SW4, SW8, SW9, SW13, SW14, SW15, 
SW18, SW19<br><br>
South West London including Twickenham, Teddington and more : TW1, TW2, TW3, TW4, 
TW5, TW7, TW8, TW9, TW10, TW11, TW12, TW14, TW17<br><br>
Twickenham MP Munira Wilson said some schools in the area will be closed due to the water 
issue. <br><br>
Ms Wilson wrote on X: “I'm trying to get more information for local residents and alarmed that 
schools are having to close because of this issue.”<br><br>
West London: W1H, W1H, W1M, W1N, W2, W3, W4, W6, W7, W10, W12, W13, W14<br><br>
The agency said they are currently “working hard to fix the issue and to get things back to 
normal.”<br><br>
In another statement released by the water company at 11:16 am, it said the power supply is now 
back on Ashford Water Treatment Works and supplies should be starting to return across the 
area.<br><br>
“The issue also had a knock-on effect at Hampton Water Treatment Works, meaning a large 
number of customers have been affected,” it added.<br><br>
A Thames Water spokesperson added: “Getting water supplies back on is our top priority and 
while our team work on this we’re identifying everyone in the affected area who has pre-
registered with us as having special requirements, such as being medically reliant on water, so 
we can get in touch and make sure we give them the help and support they need.”<br><br>
As of 12:37 pm, the water agency shared on X that the power is back on in West London
following issues earlier in the day. <br><br>
“Water is returning across the area but it will take time for our system to fully refill,” it said.
There have also been reports of a burst sewer in separate areas in London – these are:
Kingston Vale, SW15 3PT – The company said they are on site working to rectify the situation, 
which has caused a disruption to the A308 and A3.<br><br>
Thames Water said on its website it “closed the nearby sewage pumping station while we carry 
out the repair, to ensure customers can continue to use their facilities we are using tankers around
the clock to remove sewage from the site and reduce impact on the environment.”<br><br>
The pipe is set to be fixed by 22 September 2023.<br><br>
Another area hit with a pipe burst is Fieldhouse Lane, Marlow, SL7.<br><br>
Thames Water said they have switched off its nearby pumping station and will use tankers to 
transfer sewage away from the damaged pipe.<br><br>
“We’ve unfortunately had to close a lane of the northbound carriageway of the A404 in order to 
allow us to do this. We’re really sorry if your journey has been delayed as a result,” it added.
The company aims to repair the sewer as soon as possible.<br><br>
This is not the first time an area has run out of water. In 2022, amidst a lethal heatwave, residents
in an Oxfordshire village ran out of water forcing Thames Water to dispatch water tankers and 
bottled water to the area<br><br>
